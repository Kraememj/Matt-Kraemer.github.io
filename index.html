        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>I have worked for some great companies in my past including Gartner,
            Stryker, and Allegis Group. I have enjoyed my work; however I have found
            I have a passion for creating things. My goal is to be able to identify
            something in our world that can be improved and build that using the development
            principles I will learn in this program.
